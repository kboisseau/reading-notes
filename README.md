A growth mindset to me encompasses and embodies all facets of an ever improving individual. An indvidual who can adapt to change, one who shows initiative and smomeone who shows preserverance. 

I focus on having a growth mindset in a multitude of ways.
* Obstacles that i come across and knowing that in time things do get easier with  repetition and to remember the task at hand.
* Admiring ones accomplishment insteaf of having envy and knowing that with the help of others and a willingness to work on my faults until i can make it my ***strength*** only further elevates my progression
* Not having a fixed minset, in the sense of constanlty evolving and everchanging to be the best me i can, not being satisfied witht he bare  minimum but wanting better.
